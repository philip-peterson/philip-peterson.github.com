        <h1>Vectors: not what they taught you in school</h1>


        <p>Euclidean vectors (henceforth just "vectors") aren't what you probably think they are. They are <strong>not</strong> lists of numbers. A common misconception is that a vector is an n-tuple
        of coordinates, or an n&times;1 matrix.

        <p>That is <strong>not</strong> the case! Let's see the real definition...

        <blockquote>A Euclidean vector is a geometric object that has a definite magnitude and direction.</blockquote>

        <p>Vectors are geometric objects. They exist in space, and have both definite length (magnitude) and definite direction. That's it. No numbers!
        You may find this comforting &mdash; or perhaps disquieting. Either way, vectors have absolutely nothing to do with numbers, in and of themselves.

        <p>"But Philip," you contend. "Vectors are measured with numbers." That is true. But you know what else is measured with numbers? Everything.

        <p>The point is, "numbers" do not give rise to a vector, just as "teaspoons" do not give rise to sugar. Sorry... :(

        <h2>Coordinate systems</h2>
        <p>Coordinate systems are very simple to explain, but often are never defined.
        <p>A coordinate system is a system (sorry, no better word) for transforming tuples of numbers into points in space.
        <p>Pretty simple, right? Now, you're probably most familiar with cartesian coordinate systems,
        but there are other kinds of coordinate systems you've heard of, as well. One example is the polar coordinate system.
        <p>The polar coordinate system is a slightly different idea, but just like the cartesian coordinate system, it maps 2-tuples (i.e. pairs of numbers) to points in <b>E<sup>2</sup></b>.
        <p>One key difference is that in polar coordinates, each point can be represented by many different tuples, which doesn't happen in cartesian coordinates.
        <p>However, you don't always need <i>n</i> numbers to represent points in <b>E<sup>n</sup></b>. In fact, you're probably familiar with a coordinate system that maps two coordinates
        to points in <b>E<sup>3</sup></b>. Try to think of one (really! It's not that hard, and thinking is good for you)...
