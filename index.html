<h2>Google's explanation of Public Domain and why it's bad for software</h2>

<p>I cite this block of text quite often, so I think it might be appropriate to
archive it here for posterity. It comes from Google's FAQ page for its Google
Code service.

<blockquote>
<p>
Many people are attracted to the idea of releasing code in the "public domain"
-- that is, they seek to denounce their personal copyright on the code and
donate their work to the world at large.

<p>
Unfortunately, the concept of public domain is actually a lot more complicated
than most people realize. First of all, some countries (such as France) simply
don't recognize the renunciation of copyright. Such countries will still
consider you the author and copyright holder no matter what you do.
Furthermore, it's somewhat risky to release code without explicitly disclaiming
liability or warranty; you're potentially opening yourself to lawsuits from
accidental damage that may result from somebody using your software.

<p>
Instead of releasing into public domain, it's almost always a better choice to
retain your copyright and release under a minimalist, permissive open source
license such as the MIT License. The MIT license allows people to do absolutely
anything they want with your software, while still disclaiming liability and
warranty.

<p>
There are certain situations, however, where a public domain license is an
absolute requirement. For example, some government institutions require (by
law) that all code be released into the public domain. [...]
