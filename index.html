	<h1>Google's explanation of Public Domain and why it's bad for software</h1>

	<p>Published: <time pubdate="pubdate">2012-05-22</time>

	<p>I cite this block of text quite often, so I think it might be appropriate to
	archive it here for posterity. It comes from Google's <a
	href="http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/FAQ">FAQ page</a> for its Google
	Code service.</p>

	<blockquote>
	<p>Many people are attracted to the idea of releasing code in the "public domain"
	-- that is, they seek to denounce their personal copyright on the code and
	donate their work to the world at large.</p>


	<p>
	Unfortunately, the concept of public domain is actually a lot more complicated
	than most people realize. First of all, some countries (such as France) simply
	don't recognize the renunciation of copyright. Such countries will still
	consider you the author and copyright holder no matter what you do.
	Furthermore, it's somewhat risky to release code without explicitly disclaiming
	liability or warranty; you're potentially opening yourself to lawsuits from
	accidental damage that may result from somebody using your software.
	</p>

	<p>
	Instead of releasing into public domain, it's almost always a better choice to
	retain your copyright and release under a minimalist, permissive open source
	license such as the MIT License. The MIT license allows people to do absolutely
	anything they want with your software, while still disclaiming liability and
	warranty.
	</p>

	<p>
	There are certain situations, however, where a public domain license is an
	absolute requirement. For example, some government institutions require (by
	law) that all code be released into the public domain. [...]

	<h1>A tricky English phrase</h1>

	<p>Published: <time pubdate="pubdate">2013-11-08</time></p>
	
	<p>English is not the most intuitive of languages. It has its fair share of transposed letters, silent letters,
	subtle pronunciation differences based on context, and so forth.</p>
	
	<p>One common weirdness that seems to trip people up is this phrase: "a sneak peek". It's very tempting when writing
	this to want to repeat the "ea" making the "ee" sound. So, a lot of places, even highly respected news outlets, end up
	with "sneak peak" somewhere in their publications. Just another reason news outlets need more copy editors than they hire...</p>

	<p>It's also one of those things where after you've been made aware of it, you see it everywhere. You're welcome! ;-)</p>
